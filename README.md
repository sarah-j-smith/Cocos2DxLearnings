# Cocos2DxLearnings

Working through some learning projects in C++ / Cocos2D-x

Code is based on Roger Engelberts book [Cocos2D-x Beginners Guide 1st ed (2013)](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/cocos2d-x-example-beginners-guide)

I've re-written the examples for 

* Cocos2D 4.0
* C++17
* iOS & Android
* Modern C++

The last point is a bit moot - I'm not saying my code is great, the
projects are done fast and are pretty hacky. I've tried to make the code
a bit more modular, and break things out into better encapsulated files;
as I used to do in my Swift games. I also use C++11 lambda's where
appropriate, and other standard library features like std::clamp to
reduce if statement usage, for example.
